# WebsiteBlocker

<u>Lightweight Chrome extension for blocking distracting websites.</u><br>
Technically it simply blocks any request from marked websites using [chrome.declarativeNetRequest API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/declarativeNetRequest/). In practice this looks like the websites don't have access to the internet.<br>
<u>Privacy note</u>: This extension doesn't collect/send/share any data, everything (basically just urls) is kept inside local chrome.storage for extensions.
